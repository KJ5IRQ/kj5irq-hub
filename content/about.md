# About KJ5IRQ

KJ5IRQ is a ham radio callsign representing an exploration into amateur radio by Josh, a NetSuite administrator with a passion for technology and communication.  This dashboard is a minimalist hub designed to keep key information at your fingertips: weather conditions, HF propagation, node status, streaming highlights and system health.

## Motivation

Keeping information at a glance helps operators stay informed without distraction.  This site was built entirely by an AI agent as a static, responsive and accessible application.  All content and layout can be adjusted through simple JSON and Markdown files.

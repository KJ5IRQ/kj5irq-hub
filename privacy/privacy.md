# Privacy Policy — KJ5IRQ & Solo Dungeon Master GPT

**Effective date:** 2025-08-28  
**Owner & Data Controller:** KJ5IRQ (site owner)  
**Contact:** kj5irq@gmail.com

This policy explains how we handle information on **kj5irq.radio** (the “Site”) and in the **Solo Dungeon Master GPT** (the “GPT”), including optional **dice** and **image** actions.

We aim for **data minimization**: collect as little as possible, keep it for as short as necessary, and don’t sell it.

---

## 1) What we process

### a) Content you submit
- Text you type to the GPT (e.g., character names, story choices, dice or image requests).
- Optional metadata you share (e.g., save-state JSON).

### b) Technical data (Site)
- Standard web logs created by GitHub Pages (IP address, user-agent, timestamps). These are handled by GitHub as our host; see **Third-party processors** below.

### c) Actions (third-party APIs)
- **Dice**: we send only the dice expression (e.g., `1d20+5`) to the Rolz API.
- **Images**: we send only the text prompt you request to OpenAI’s Images API.

We **don’t** intentionally collect sensitive categories of personal data.

---

## 2) What we **don’t** do
- No selling or “sharing” of personal information as defined by the **CCPA/CPRA**.  
- No behavioral advertising on the Site.  
- No cookies or analytics by default on the Site. (If this changes, we’ll add a cookie banner and update this page.)  
- No child-directed features; the GPT is **not for children under 13**.  

---

## 3) Why we process data (lawful bases)

- **Provide the service** (run the Site/GPT; fulfill dice and image requests).  
- **Legitimate interests** (security, abuse prevention, troubleshooting).  
- **Consent** (where you actively ask us to perform an action, e.g., generate an image).

If you’re in the EEA/UK, you have rights under GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, objection).

---

## 4) Third-party processors

We rely on these providers to run the Site/GPT. Each receives only what’s needed to perform the function you requested.

- **GitHub Pages** (Site hosting). GitHub processes standard server logs and operates the hosting platform.  
- **OpenAI (Images API)** for image generation. For API usage, OpenAI states it **does not use API data to train models by default**; see OpenAI’s data usage policies.  
- **Rolz** (dice API) for random dice results. Requests include only the dice expression.  

We do not control these providers’ independent practices; review their policies for details.

---

## 5) Retention

- **GPT prompts/results:** transient in the session unless you save them.  
- **Actions:** requests are logged by the respective API providers for operations/security; we don’t keep separate copies.  
- **Site logs:** retained by GitHub under its policies.  

We keep only what we must for functionality, security, or legal obligations, then delete or anonymize.

---

## 6) Security

- Transport encryption (HTTPS).  
- Least-data principle: we send only the minimal text necessary to Actions.  
- Access to admin accounts protected with strong authentication.  
- If a personal-data breach occurs affecting users in the EEA/UK, we’ll follow **GDPR breach-notification** duties (report to authorities within 72 hours where required and inform affected users when risk is high).

---

## 7) International transfers

If data is processed outside your region (e.g., US-hosted services for EU/UK users), transfers will rely on appropriate safeguards such as the **EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** adopted by the European Commission.

---

## 8) Your privacy rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- **Access** your data and **receive a copy**.  
- **Rectify** inaccurate data; **erase** data; **restrict** or **object** to processing; **data portability** (GDPR).  
- **CPRA/CCPA (California):** know what categories of personal information are collected, used, disclosed; request deletion; correct inaccuracies; opt out of sale/share; and be free from discrimination for exercising rights.

**How to exercise:** email privacy@kj5irq.radio with “Privacy Request,” state your jurisdiction, and describe the request. We’ll verify and respond within applicable timelines.

---

## 9) Do Not Track (DNT)

Some browsers send DNT signals. The Site **does not track** users across third-party websites and therefore **does not respond to DNT**.

---

## 10) Children’s privacy

The Site and GPT are not directed to children under 13, and we don’t knowingly collect personal information from them. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us to remove it.

---

## 11) Changes

We’ll update this page when practices or providers change. The “Effective date” shows when the latest version took effect.
